About the game:

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (abbreviated as CS:GO) is an online first-person shooter developed by Valve Corporation and Hidden Path Entertainment.
Like the previous games in the series, Global Offensive is an objective-based multiplayer first-person shooter. 
Each player joins either the Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist team and attempts to complete objectives or eliminate the enemy team. 
The game operates in short rounds that end when all players on one side are dead or a team's objective is completed. 
For most game modes, once a player dies, they must wait until the round ends to respawn.
Counter Strike Global Offensive adds new weapons and equipment not seen in previous installments, 
most notably the firebomb for each side (Molotovs for Terrorists and incendiary grenades for Counter-Terrorists).....
